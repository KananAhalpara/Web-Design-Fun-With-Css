ASSIGNMENT : AS FOLLOWS :



Fun with CSS3 Effects
Try out some CSS3 effects from the list below. Create a simple one-box layout with some sample images/text to show off the new awesome effects! 
Guidelines
Simple design. No fancy headers, navs. Just a single box with some text and/or images (whatever objects you need to show off your desired effects)
Don’t worry about making it ‘beautiful’ - make it obvious that you understand how to generate and apply the code. (Animation from white to black, for example)
You get 1 point for each type of effect used. These are grouped into categories below. (You may use multiple effects for each category, but you only get points for the first two (2) you use in any given category)
Will be validated using Chrome so do not worry about that backwards compatibility stuff right now. Just play and have fun!
Important: Be sure to comment the effect you used in the css file, for example:

/* rounded corners */
.rounded {
     background: #990000;
     border-radius: 5px;
}
